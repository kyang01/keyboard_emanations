- [signal_processinglib] create_video -> fix video mn, mx cutoff 
- [StartingWidgets] create_decoder -> general clip video 
- [signal_processinglib] fix determine_offset of audio to label
- check out where resaving is occuring

- threshold_keystrokes-> FIX CURRENTLY BROKEN, checkbox to create video from preprocessing notebook, better integration of known info, characters to plot
- cluster_keystrokes -> add ui buttons, additional display when labels exist (and dont exist)
- predict_text -> need to fix visibility of button, predicts the text after the clusters are created, abstract out transition probability, hmm should have garbage output, tuned probability that can be adjusted to throw away keystrokes in the hmm
- start_confuser -> connect bens stuff, add listener to current environment, inject only when typing, inject user specific audio
