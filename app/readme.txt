- [signal_processinglib] create_video -> fix video mn, mx cutoff 
- [StartingWidgets] create_decoder -> general clip video 
- [signal_processinglib] fix determine_offset of audio to label
- check out where resaving is occuring
- make sure choosing None works properly

- threshold_keystrokes-> checkbox to create video from preprocessing notebook, better integration of known info, characters to plot
- cluster_keystrokes -> additional display when labels exist (and dont exist)
- predict_text -> need to fix visibility of button, abstract out parameters: transition probability, hmm should have garbage output, tuned probability that can be adjusted to throw away keystrokes in the hmm
- start_confuser -> inject user specific audio
