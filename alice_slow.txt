alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white abbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be too late but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or watch to take out of it and burning wit curiosity she ran acrross the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped sudddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her first she tried to make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the wall and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves she passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar so managed to put it into one of the cupboardsa as she fell past it down down down would the fall never come to an end there was nothing ele to do
