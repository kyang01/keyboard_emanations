# keyboard_emanations

Exploring unsupervised learning techniques for predicting keystrokes presses only using the raw audio.

```

Note: Much of the data we used is missing due to file contraints of github. 

PreProcessing.ipynb  is where the peak detection and data visualization is done

Processing.ipynb is where the machine kmeans/hmm model is implemented 

## Dependencies 

matplotlib.animation among others (ffmpeg) 

TODO - Coming Soon
