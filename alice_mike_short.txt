alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice shad peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book throught alice without pictures of conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a diasy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the diases when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor diad alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabiit say to itself oh dear i shall be too late when she thought it over afterwards ti occurrered to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice when the rabbit actuallly took a watch out of it s pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that he had never seen a rabbit when eithe a wastcoast pocke t or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see ti pop downa a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another momrnt after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole uder the hedge in a nother moment plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to ahppen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anythinng then she looked at the sidess of the well and noticed that there were coming to filled with cupboards and bookshelves her and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down ajar bfrom one of the bookshelves there alice was beginning to to get every day wrong.
