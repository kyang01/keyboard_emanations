alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book throught alice without pictures of conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor diad alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear i shall be too late when she thought it over aftwarwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it seemed quite nautral but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that he had never seen a rabbit with either a wastcoast pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning withc curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a larg rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment alice went down after it never once considrgin how int eh world she was to g et out again the rabbit hole went tonn tunnel for some way and then dis dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemeed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticedd that they were coming to filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down ajar from one of the shelves and passed it along it was labelled orange but to her disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one fo the cupboards as she fell past it well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all see me at home why i wouldnt say anythig about it even if i fell of the top of the house which was very likely truedown down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen bt this time she said aloud i must be getting somewhere ear the center of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the scholroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was a good practice to say it over yes that is about the right distance but i wonder what latitude or longitude i have got to do persently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it will seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards the antipathies i think but i shall ask them what the name of their country is you know and what a ignorant girl they think me down down down therw was nothing else to do so alice began talking again i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air
