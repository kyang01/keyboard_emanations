alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chai would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when sudenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing as remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be too late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its pocket and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just about to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in anoether moment went dow alice after it never considering how in the world she was to get out again the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down and so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was ging to happen next first she tried to look down and wonder what was coming next but it was too dark to make out anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboardsa and book shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hungs upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed first but to her disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so she managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she feell past it well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave they will think me at home why i would not say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely true alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and whaat is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was consdiering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble there was nothing so very remarkable about that in it nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be too late when she thought it over afterwards she realized that she ought to have wondered at this zebra xylophone but for it flashed across her mind that she had never seen a rabbit with either a pocket or a watch to take out of it and buning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and she wanted to think about it before stpping herself and faling down what seemed to be a very deep well in another moment alice went down after it never considering how in the world she was to g et out again
